# inspectoRGadget

The goal of inspectoRGadget is to meet an urgent need spelled out in this [twitter plea](https://twitter.com/CausalKathy/status/999091807937028096)

## Installation

You can install the development version of `inspectoRGadget` from [github](https://www.github.com) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("adam-gruer/inspectoRGadget")
 
```

## Example

Step 1: **gadgetize** your favourite installed package by calling `gogo_gadget_arms()`
  Wowsers!  All that package's functions and objects can now be used by typing
  `gogo_{function/object}`
```r
library(inspectoRGadget)

gogo_gadget_arms("dplyr")
```
  
```{r gadgetize, include=FALSE}
library(inspectoRGadget)
gogo_gadget_arms("dplyr")
```

Step 2: **gogo_** all the things!
  Here we `gogo_filter()` the `beaver1` dataset to find when the critter was active
```{r gogo_filter}
gogo_filter(beaver1, activ == 1)
```

All those gogo_s now live in your search path in an environment called `gadget_arms`
(thanks for the [tip Hadley Wickam!](https://github.com/adam-gruer/inspectoRGadget/issues/2))

This _is not really important_ unless you have already loaded an important,
useful package also called `gadget_arms`. In that case, sorry, together we probably busted 
something, I see error messages in your future.
